== FAQ ==

= What is a Adaptive Editor? = 

Adaptive Editors serve two pages, a Mobile page and a Desktop page.

= What are the advantages of this type of editor? = 

You can use the editor to create very custom pages suited to your users device.

= When should I use the page builder visual editor? =  

You should use the editor when you want a page that has design, not just a blog entry.


= What extra features does the advanced page builder editor have? =  

The advanced page builder has blank templates, video background templates, image background templates, and css transitions.
The visual editor also removes extra HTML the editor needs to function, allowing for faster download time.

= Image and video backgrounds built with the editor? =  

The Adaptive Editor bypasses your theme  and displays a blank template that loads a video or image in the background of the page. Since the HTML5 editor is 3D in nature you can layer and render objects that overlay the background of the page.

= What upgrades will be in new versions of the visual editor? =  

The current beta build of the visual editor has timelines for CSS transitions, and full page builder options outside of your theme.


= Can I edit my old pages with the editor? =  

No. The visual editor is a page builder, this means it requires a format for the HTML editor to function in drag and drop.

= Parallax Scrolling? =   

Parallax Scrolling allows objects to scroll at different speeds giving the illusion of 3D, the concept is used in cartoons and games to show movement. The page builder has a easy to use transistions pallete to set these options.

= Outside your theme Page Builder? =

Simply Symphony Advaced Version of the page builder can bypass your theme to create full blank pages you build from scratch.

= Page Builder Margins? =

The page builder has red and blue margins, if you edit within the blue margins you are safe, outside the blue you will need to test for overlap.


= Page Builder Inline Editor? =

The page builder inline editor is for fine tuning your page.
